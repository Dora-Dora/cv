Dear hiring manager,

As a recent PhD graduate pivoting from computational biology to data science for social good, I am excited to apply to DNC Data Scientist position. During my PhD, I gained analytical, coding, and communication skills which I am confident will make me a successful data scientist. Combined with my advocacy and leadership experiences, my background uniquely positions me for the role of data scientist providing progressive candidates with the resources and insights they need to win.

As part of my PhD projects, I wrangled complex metadata from a clinical collaborator, hunted down raw data for a large meta-analysis, and mined high-dimensional datasets to extract biological insights. Beyond my projects, I was our lab’s AWS administrator, mentored an undergraduate and Master’s student, and helped my advisor manage key large projects in the lab. I was also a leader in building community in my lab, helping to organize our lab retreat for three years and hosting workshops to share knowledge between lab members.

Outside of research, I gained crucial communication skills through my training to become a conflict coach for my peers and became deeply knowledgeable about diversity and equity issues through co-starting my department’s application assistance program and being part of the founding leadership team for MIT’s Graduate Student Council’s new Diversity, Equity, and Inclusion Committee. These experiences fueled my passions and provided deep satisfaction beyond my research, motivating me to find a position where I can apply my technical skills to positively impact society. Finally, I also value and have experience with connecting with non-technical audiences: as a co-founder of the MIT Microbiome Club and co-organizer of the annual MIT-Harvard Microbiome Symposium, I supported community outreach efforts and emphasized making technical presentations accessible to non-technical audiences.

As part of the DNC Data Team, I am excited to develop my data science skills while providing useful and actionable insights to help Democratic candidates win. Please let me know if you would like any additional information, and I look forward to hearing back from you.

Sincerely,

Claire Duvallet, PhD
