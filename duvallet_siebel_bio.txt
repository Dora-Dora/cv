Claire is currently a PhD student in the Biological Engineering department at MIT in Eric Alm's lab, where she studies the relationship between the human microbiome and health and disease. She applies various physiological data to predict and understand disease, both on the individualized and broader community levels. More generally, Claire is interested in applying personalized medicine approaches for public health.

Outside of lab, Claire works to improve the MIT graduate student experience through diversity, equity, and inclusion initiatives and conflict management skills. She has served as Diversity Chair of the BE Graduate Student Board since her second year, where she co-started the BE Application Assistance Program and co-wrote the BE Departmentâ€™s Community Values Statement, and is now helping shape the Graduate Student Council's new Diversity and Inclusion Subcommittee. Claire is also a trained member of the BE REFS, where she provides confidential conflict coaching to students and hosts workshops to share conflict management skills and empower students to improve their own graduate experiences. Finally, Claire helped start the MIT Microbiome Club and organized the first two MIT-Harvard Microbiome Symposia, which together engage over 1000 members of the Boston-area microbiome community. She also enjoys mentoring and outreach, and participated in Science Club for Girls' Young Leaders in STEM program for two summers, where she developed and taught a 3-day lesson on microbiology and the microbiome. In her free time, you can find Claire outside chasing after a frisbee with the MIT women's ultimate frisbee team.
